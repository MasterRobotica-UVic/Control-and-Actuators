# Control and Actuators

Interactive notes about the course. The notes are written using Jupyter, that you can install in your PC following [this link](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). My suggestion is to use the Anaconda way.

Notes index:

1. [Sequences and Linear Difference Equations](sequences.ipynb)
2. [Proportional control with Difference Equations](proportional_control.ipynb)
3. [Higher order systems](higher_order_systems.ipynb)
